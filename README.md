## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will make use of a pocket-size data sample that is suitable for doing everything with your laptop, or even with your phone if you can connect a keybord to it :-).
But before going to technicalities of how we a data analysis, few general things to see and appreciate.

* [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)
* [LHC video, absolute must see!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQhbhpU9Wrg)
* [CMS video, all what you need to know for getting started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S99d9BQmGB0)


The [LHC](https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) experiements use [ROOT](https://root.cern) to analyze and **store** the information recorded during hadronic collisions.
So, if you would want to study the interactions taking place upon colliding protons running almost at the speed of light you need to learn how to open and read the ROOT files produced by the experiements.


### Reading ROOT files without installing ROOT aka uproot/awkward
