# LazyHEPTutorial

This is meant to be an introduction on how to analyze data from LHC experiments.

## Introduction
The [LHC](https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) experiements use [ROOT](https://root.cern) to analyze and **store** the information recorded during hadronic collisions.
So, if you would want to study the interactions taking place upon colliding protons running almost at the speed of light you need to learn how to open and read the ROOT files produced by the experiements.
In this tutorial, we will make use of a pocket-size data sample that is suitable for doing everything with your laptop, or even with your phone if you can connect a keybord to it :-).
